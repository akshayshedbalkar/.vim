# .vim

This .vim folder contains a .vimrc file and plugins. 

The folder should be placed in the HOME directory and the .vimrc file should be copied over to the HOME directory. 

The plugins are contained as submodules. Read the submodule_tutorial.txt to quickly clone the entire repository. 

The airline plugin causes around 400ms delay on vim startup (at least on my system). This folder can be deleted if the delay is bothersome.
